# Power-BI-Data-Professional-Summery-Project

Data Professional Survey – Power BI Dashboard
This repository contains an end-to-end Power BI analytics project built using a global survey of data professionals. 
The goal of this project is to transform raw survey responses into meaningful insights about job roles, salaries, demographics, tools, and career satisfaction within the data industry.

Project Overview
The Data Professional Survey Dashboard provides an interactive and visual exploration of key industry trends.
Using Power Query, DAX, and Power BI Desktop, the dataset was cleaned, modeled, and transformed into a multi-page dashboard designed for clarity and usability.


The dashboard allows users to explore: 
Salary patterns across countries and job roles
Tool and technology preferences (Python, SQL, Power BI, etc.)
Job satisfaction and work–life balance
Demographics such as gender, age, and education level
Perceived difficulty of entering the data profession
